               <p class="content_testimonial">I am very thankful for meeting Available tutors. They have been working with my child since 3rd grade. Now he is in 8th Grade. He <br>went from being a struggling student to Principal’s Honor Roll. He now takes Honor’s classes. Not only academically, they also <br>provided mentoring for my child. He is self motivated. I strongly recommend this company.</p>

               <p class="content_testimonial">Available Tutors helped my child. I wanted my child to read really fast and I enrolled for 1 hour daily. In 3 months my child was <br>reading 3rd grade level in Kindergarten. The teacher called me to find out how it happened, from my son just being able to sound <br>out words in September to 3rd grade level reading in December. I strongly recommend them. I did not stop there, I immediately <br>enrolled my daughter too and same thing happen, she was reading second grade level in 1st Quarter kindergarten. I am really 
                  <br>impressed. I strongly recommend them.
